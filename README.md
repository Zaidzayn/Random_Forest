# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier – Machine Learning Exploration

This repository showcases my journey in learning and applying **Random Forest** along with a complete Machine Learning workflow. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, training multiple algorithms, and tuning them using **GridSearchCV** for optimal performance.

## 📌 What I Learned

- ✅ How to **clean, preprocess, and manipulate data** using `pandas` and `numpy`
- ✅ Building machine learning models using **Random Forest** and comparing it with others like SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, etc.
- ✅ Using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters for maximum model performance
- ✅ Evaluating models with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ✅ Visualizing results using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`

Removed irrelevant columns

Scaled/normalized data (if needed)

3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized feature distributions

Detected class imbalances

Used heatmaps for correlation analysis

4. 🤖 Model Building
✅ Trained multiple models:
Random Forest

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

5. 🔍 Model Tuning with GridSearchCV
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy']
}

grid = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best Parameters:", grid.best_params_)
